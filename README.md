# vimconfig
My personal ViM config

This repo allows me to deploy my ViM env to all my servers/machines

I mostly do LAMP dev and sysadmin tasks on Debian 7/8 servers, so if you think
it might suit your needs too, feel free to clone it :)

Update: 
NeoComplete and NeoSnippet are now included (requires vim to be compiled with LUA support - installing vim-nox package takes care of this)

*How to install :
1) Clone this repo from your home directory 
2) cd to vimconfig
3) run install.sh
4) Done =)
