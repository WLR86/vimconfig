# vimconfig
My personal ViM config

I'm a ViM lover, although I used and tested a whole bunch of text editors and IDEs, ViM is still my favorite tool.
This repo allows me to deploy my ViM env to all my servers/machines

I mostly do LAMP dev and sysadmin tasks on Debian 7/8 servers, so if you think
it might suit your needs too, feel free to clone it :)

Update: 
NeoComplete and NeoSnippet are now included
Note that NeoComplete requires vim to be compiled with LUA support - installing vim-nox package takes care of this :
$ sudo apt install vim-nox

*How to install :
1) Clone this repo from your home directory 
2) cd to vimconfig
3) run install.sh
4) Done =)
